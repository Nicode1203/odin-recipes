    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>4 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>
      <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
      <li>Sliced onions</li>
      <li>Pickles</li>
      <li>Ketchup</li>
      <li>Mustard</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, black pepper, garlic
        powder, and onion powder. Mix gently until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the beef mixture into four equal portions and shape each portion
        into a patty, about 3/4-inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the
        center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them from puffing up
        while cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a stovetop, heat a
        grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the burger patties on the preheated grill or pan. Cook for about
        4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until they reach your
        desired level of doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of
        each patty to melt. You can also toast the hamburger buns on the grill
        or in a toaster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the burger patties from the grill and let them rest for a few
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the burgers by placing each patty on the bottom half of a
        toasted bun. Top with lettuce, tomato slices, onions, pickles, and your
        favorite condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with the top half of the bun and serve immediately. Enjoy your
        Perfect Homemade Burger!
