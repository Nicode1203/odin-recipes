    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil for brushing</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: sliced pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the active dry yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until the dough starts to come together.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, such as sliced pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, or olives.</li>
        <li>Brush the edges of the crust with olive oil to help it brown nicely.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the hot pizza stone) and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
